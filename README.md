This GitHub started with a hand-coded site for Saigon Community Radio... doin my bit to strengthen the alternative musick scene in Vietnam.  
From that moment I've been shifting deeper into tech â€” now 2/3rds through a Computer Science degree, focused on game development, VR, and logic-based design.  
ðŸ§  My background in education, philosophy, and community-building still shapes how I code, collaborate, and create.  
ðŸ“« Reach me on Discord: joke232323 â€” open to thoughtful collabs and immersive ideas.
